# privilegedRoleAssignment: makeEligible

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [pim-v2AADRoles-deprecation](../../includes/pim-v2AADRoles-deprecation.md)]

Make the role assignment eligible. If the role assignment is already eligible before the call, it does nothing. If the role assignment is permanent and the requestor is different from the target user, the role assignment will become eligible and the role will be deactivated for the target user. If the requestor is the target user and the role is Security Administrator or Privileged Role Administrator, the role will be activated with the default expiration.

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

The requestor needs to have _Privileged Role Administrator_ role.
